## Apps Included

### 1. **Paint**
   - Draw using the `A` and `B` buttons to move the cursor and use `A+B` to mark pixels.
   - Cursor movement is wrapped (i.e., it will move from one side to the other when going past the edges).
   
### 2. **GetMe**
   - A simple game where you control the player to collect randomly placed apples.
   - Use `A` to move right and `B` to move down. If you go off-screen, it wraps around.

### 3. **MicroChat**
   - A messaging app where you can send `0` and `1` to another micro:bit.
   - Press `A` to send `0` and `B` to send `1`.

### 4. **MusicMaker**
   - Press `A` and `B` to create sounds.
   - Different combinations produce different musical notes.

### 5. **Power Off**
   - Press the **reset button** to turn off the system (disables inputs and clears the screen).
